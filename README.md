## Front matter
This README file documents the results of our study [Shared associations identify causal relationships between gene expression and immune cell phenotypes](submitted). Here we provide an overview of the code provided in this distribution, the software dependencies, and the sources of genotype, gene expression and immune cell phenotype data required.   

## Disclaimers
* Throughout, we use the SLURM job scheduling system to distribute some of the more compute-intensive analyses on a cluster. We have tagged all instances with `#SLURM` in `MasterScript.sh` for ease of reference.
* The code here is provided as-is. We have validated that this runs without errors on our own systems, but do not guarantee that this will be the case in different computing environments.
